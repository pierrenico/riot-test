We're going to write a very basic Rust web app.

It has 4 endpoints:
- encrypt
- decrypt
- sign
- verify

See the spec.md file for the details, and the plan.md file for the current plan.

Whenever we code something, we should always check the spec to see if we're on the right track. When we finish coding a step, we need to update the plan to check steps we've completed.
